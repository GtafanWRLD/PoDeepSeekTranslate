## üîß Making Your Own Translations

You can use the provided tools to build your own translation set:

1. **Extract `.po` files**
   - Use tools like `msgunfmt` or `polib` to decompile `.mo` files into `.po` files.
   - Place them in `Decompiled_PO_Mixed/`.

2. **Merge with existing translations**
   - Use `merge_po.py` to combine your current `.po` with the latest Russian source.

3. **Translate**
   - Use `po_translator_gpt3.5.py` for automatic GPT-based translations.
   - Or try the experimental `po_translator_gpt3.5_pre_release.py` for multi-language support.

4. **Compile back to `.mo`** (optional)
   - Using `polib`:
     ```python
     import polib
     po = polib.pofile("translated.po")
     po.save_as_mofile("translated.mo")
     ```
